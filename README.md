# QsysProxyPlugin
QSC Q-SYS Core TCP Proxy Plugin

Released 2019-08-07 v0.16

## About
A plugin for Q-SYS to proxy an inbound TCP connection to another destination.

The inbound listen port and the destination host and port must be set in the properties.

This can be useful to e.g. forward SSH connections from one network to devices on another port of the Core.

Firmware - tested on 7.2.1, believe it also works on 8.0.
